I’d like to start by giving a shoutout to quarantine. Without quarantine, one of mankind’s great mysteries might still be left unsolved: Who is truly the funniest friend in Friends?

Once you ask yourself that question, it never leaves your thoughts.

That’s what happened to me a few weeks ago. And so I did the only rational thing I could: I decided to harness the cutting edge powers of artificial intelligence to find out if Ross’s dinosaur jokes are funnier than Phoebe’s non-sequiturs.

**Fair warning: Prepare to be surprised!**

First a caveat before we dive in: humor is relative. What you find funny I may not. Also it is hard to measure. Luckily, most Friends scenes were filmed in front of a live audience of 300 people. When a lot of these people laugh, I assume something is probably funny. Now of course, laughter can be edited in post-production. But for our sake, we’re going to assume the audience laughter is a close enough proxy to something actually being funny.

Second, I only captured spoken lines in this analysis. That means characters don’t always get credit for their non-verbal humor. Fortunately, less than 3% of the laughter in the show is due to non-verbal cues.

If you’re wondering how AI can possibly figure out who is funny, [here’s](https://jacksanford.me) my explanation of the technical aspects of the project.

In case you were hoping to stay awake instead, here’s a cool demo video showing what it looks like:

Now for the awards ceremony.

The award for the longest continuous laughter goes to Joey. Joey made the audience laugh for a full 30 seconds straight when going through his fake resume skills with Phoebe. (S10E13) He wrote that he could chug a gallon of milk in under 10 seconds on his resume. Phoebe called him out. He immediately went to the fridge and grabbed a gallon of milk and proceeded to “chug” (i.e. spill it down the front of his shirt) for a full 30 seconds. Peak Joey moment.

The award for the funniest episode goes to “The One Where the Stripper Cries” (S10E11). I immediately rewatched this episode when I found out and it definitely lives up to the hype. What could be better than a Danny DeVito guest appearance where he “strips” in a cop outfit for Phoebe’s bachelorette party? But there’s more! The episode is full of high school and college flashbacks starring “fat Monica”, Rachel’s full-bodied nose, and Chandler’s hairstyle which...I can't describe so just see below. Not to mention we find out Ross kissed Monica in college! And to top it off, Joey goes on a game show and gives a performance that only Joey could be capable of.

In contrast, the least funny episode turns out to be “The One with the Invitation” (S4E21). This was a heavier episode that flashed back through the highs and lows of Ross and Rachel’s entire relationship up to that point. Ross was about to marry Emily in England and Rachel had to wrestle with whether she wanted to attend the wedding or not (we all remember how that turns out).

In terms of the funniest seasons, the results are quite interesting (possibly incriminating?). As you can see in the chart below, the amount of laughter per season tends to keep going up as the show progressed. Were seasons 9 and 10 really THAT much funnier than seasons 1 and 2? I’ll let you decide for yourself. But this could point to the producers becoming more liberal with their inclusion of laughter as the show went on. But seeing the glass half-full, I like to think the writing simply got better as the show went on!

Now for the main course: Who is the funniest friend?

The natural thing to do would be to add up each character’s funny lines to see who is funniest. But I think this is unfair. Some characters (ahem Rachel and Ross) speak WAY more lines than other characters (poor Phoebe).

So instead, we will say, if somebody speaks a line, how much laughter follows on average? (judged by seconds of laughter)

Here are the results you've been waiting for:

#### 6th place: Monica

Is anyone surprised here? Monica tends to be the “responsible” one who keeps things on track. She usually has her hands full correcting the foibles of her more hapless friends and keeping her nice china from breaking. To her credit, everyone realizes this and Ross and Rachel even admit they would allow Monica to raise their child solo but not Chandler (S9E8). Every friend group needs a Monica.

#### 5th place: Rachel

I’m going to be honest, this one surprised me. Early in the series, it seemed like laughter followed everything Rachel did. She was introduced to us as a runaway “daddy’s girl” and watching her face realities like making coffee and getting “one of those job things” was immensely humorous. But her saga with Ross soon took over and apparently she got more serious.

#### 4th place: Ross

This almost seems high to me! Ross tends to be on the more serious side of things (married 3 times, has a PhD, is a paleontologist) and tends to take comments from other characters at face-value as well. He definitely has a goofy side and loves his nerdy jokes but he and Rachel were in tumultuous romantic situations throughout the series so it makes sense that they would have more “serious” lines.

#### 3rd place: Phoebe

Phoebe and the 2nd place character are so close! There’s a very big gap between Phoebe and Ross so I officially declare Phoebe to be a very funny character. It’s unfortunate that she didn’t get as many lines as the other characters but it’s true that she nearly always lived away from the group. That said, she was a constant source of comedic relief with her “alternative” remedies and street-smart roots.

#### 2nd place: Chandler

I had no idea where Chandler would fall. He’s definitely a funny guy but his humor is a little dry, possibly cynical, compared to the rest of the group. Chandler seems like the type of guy who is not directly engaged in a conversation but is always looking for a funny interpretation of what someone else said.  But he tends to keep people in check and he certainly knows how to lighten the mood.

#### 1st place: Joey

I suspected Joey would do well. The best part about Joey being the funniest character is that he doesn’t try to tell a lot of jokes. Most of his humor isn’t really intentional. He kind of innocently misinterprets things and we sort of laugh with him, sort of laugh at him. But I honestly have a hard time remembering Joey lines that aren’t hilarious. And his facial expressions are one-of-a-kind.

No matter how you slice the data, these rankings pretty much hold. One exception is that Ross generates more laughter than Phoebe throughout the entire show, but he also gets way more lines throughout the show, so it would be hard to say that he’s actually funnier than Phoebe. It’s also interesting to note that Chandler actually has more funny lines than Joey. It’s just that when Joey says something funny, the audience laughs longer than they do for Chandler (by 6% on average!).
