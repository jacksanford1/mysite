Hi, I'm Jack.

I'm currently a digital nomad but I most recently lived in SF for 6 years. I'm working on [Sherlock](https://twitter.com/Sherlock_DeFi). I'm interested in programming, blockchain and studying economies/governments. I also spent some time in machine learning and wrote some articles about it.

You can find more of me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_LeslieIV).
