Hi, I'm Jack.

I'm quite nomadic currently but I most recently lived in SF for 6 years. I'm building [Sherlock](https://twitter.com/Sherlock_DeFi) to make crypto a safer place for all. I'm mostly interested in programming, crypto and economics. I also spent time in machine learning and wrote some articles about it.
