Hi, I'm Jack.

I live in New York City. In the past, I've lived in Amsterdam, Austin, and San Francisco. 

I'm building [Sherlock](https://twitter.com/sherlockdefi) to make crypto a safer place for everyone. 

I'm mostly interested in programming, crypto and economics. I also spent time in machine learning and wrote some articles about it.
